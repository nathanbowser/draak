- Add routing support for all http methods, not that they really matter ;)
- Named parameters in the url
        e.g.
                /people/:name -> the closure will receive 'name' with the value from the url
- Closure block should receive request & response objects
- Helpers closure, which will expose new methods to all the routing closures
        e.g.
                helpers {
                    foo = {

                    }
                    baz = {

                    }
                }
- Custom port/server
- Module server usage (plug and play server architecture)
- Filters
